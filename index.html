                            We are a link between you (the sponsor) and the association/team. We mediate the contact
                            between the sponsor and the association/team. We help with all administration (agreement,
                            invoicing, payment to the team/association, re-reporting, etc.) and make it easier for the
                            sponsor and the team.

                            We are very open and transparent. Obviously, like all other companies, we also make money
                            from this, but unlike most companies, we show openly our merit. For us, Sponsorportalen is
                            more than a company and money, read more about us here

                                    The boy was 6 years old, the first football school was completed and a letter
                                    arrived from the local football association. "If you want your children to continue
                                    practicing football, it is necessary for parents to stand up as coaches and team
                                    managers." The association assists with materials, advice, and training.
                                    Why not, we thought, we would still be driving the boy to train, sit and wait for
                                    him until training is finished. Then you might as well bring some balls and cones
                                    and organize some games and exercises. We'll see if the boy is even interested.
                                    10 years later, you looked back and realized that you spent thousands and thousands
                                    of hours as father/coach/team manager/treasurer/administrator/driver on a bunch of
                                    lovely guys who stayed together for 10 years through thick and thin, traveled the
                                    country on cups and matches, fought many fights on the football field but also off
                                    the football field.

                                    When you as an outsider think of a youth team, you think of training and matches.
                                    Well, most of it revolves around training and matches. But association life is so
                                    much more. Each team is like a small company with a division of tasks, finances, and
                                    a lot of hard work. Membership and training fees must be collected from the
                                    association because without a functioning association there are no teams. If you
                                    want to have something fun besides training and playing local matches against the
                                    same team over and over again, you have to draw money. Not everything can be paid
                                    out of pocket. Everything costs money. Not everyone can afford it.
                                    We had a philosophy: EVERYONE should join, regardless of background, status, and
                                    finances! That's why we sold lottery tickets and everything possible, distributed
                                    newspapers, stood as hosts and ball callers at Allsvenskan matches, picked up trash.

                                    To see happy guys go on the cup and experience things most people could never afford
                                    was an incredible satisfaction for all the hard work, it was worth every drop of
                                    sweat, every hour of work of thousands of working hours, all frozen toes, too little
                                    sleep.
                                    The team was a lovely mix of different nationalities. Most of the boys lived in
                                    socially disadvantaged areas, most could barely afford soccer shoes, and most of
                                    them never got a ride to training and matches... But the vast majority stayed
                                    together for 10 years, during the "worst" youth period, trained 4-5 times a week,
                                    and played 1-2 games a week. Their life was football and there was no time for
                                    nonsense.

                                    No one became a professional soccer player even though many were very talented but
                                    the biggest gain for all the boys, all the parents, all the families, and the whole
                                    society was that no one got in contact with crime.
                                    Because they had an alternative! But we were lucky! My coaching colleagues and I had
                                    good contacts! We knew people who knew people. We could fix quests, earn money, find
                                    sponsors.
                                    But not everyone is lucky. They need guidance from those who understand. That's how
